Percy Jackson isn't a great movie, but it's a good one, trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references. The pleasant surprise is how deftly the story translates the myths from their classical idiom into modern ones and without losing the classical flavor It's not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on. Columbus and company have crafted an agreeable mythological jaunt the whole family will enjoy, and while I wouldn't pay more than matinee prices that still means making the quest to the multiplex is a journey worthy of the undertaking. It provides a great adventure movie for the family audience. If they'd played it for laughs it might just have worked, but in fact its earnest tone and digimation effects stick pretty close to the Potter model. We could be in for a very long haul. An attempt to steal some of Harry Potter's thunder that also stands on its own as a well-made large-scale adventure that works well enough to entertain the teens it's hoping to strike. ...great fun for the whole family. And if it introduces you and any young readers in your home to the books, so much the better. ...an agreeable fantasy adventure that should leave fans of the genre satisfied. While it certainly isn't terrible, it plays like a low-rent variation of the Harry Potter formula--innocuous but instantly forgettable. Percy Jackson is simply uninspired in every single meaning of the word. It's probably the crassest, most obviously derivative work of this sort since Eragon. The plot is a pretty blatant rehash of the typical \\\"coming-of-age hero\\\" tropes. Still, while \\\"Percy Jackson\\\" may not end up being the next huge and successful franchise, at the very least, it was an honest and amusing two hours. Harry Potter meets Clash of the Titans \\u2026 The backdrop of Greek mythology makes an enjoyable change of pace from the medieval fantasy magic of the Potter stories. This action-packed fantasy adventure, based on Rick Riordan's hit Percy Jackson and the Olympians series of books, is great fun, and deserves to find an audience with teens now bereft of any Harry Potter magic. While you suspect it's really just a big Clash Of The Titans spoiler, there's enough action in Jackson to make it succeed on its own terms. Lerman's a likeable lead, though it's the game supporting cast that keeps you watching. For what it is and for whom it is intended, it's not a bad movie, just an indifferent one. Even with all its computer-generated fireballs, it's lukewarm medium-budget blockbustering. \\\"It is a bit hard to see quite where Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief's market lies. Too adult for juveniles, too juvenile for adults. With great effects (and a few surprises) it's a fun, Saturday-matinee adventure. gets so many things right that when it goes astray that you kind of wish it hadn't tried in the first place The best thing you can say about Chris Columbus's adaptation is that he's incapable of destroying whatever magic and wonder it is in these books that has kept kids coming back for more. Mildly diverting. It's fantastic fun, it knows its Greek mythology, and it's a very promising start to a franchise. More of the same, please. ...an attempt to replicate the phenomenon that is Harry Potter. Whew boy. Columbus knows his way around this kind of material even if some of the special effects look like they came from Deep Discount. Although the standard allegorical bases for mythical-quest movies are dutifully covered, the obvious similarity of Percy Jackson to the Harry Potter movies inevitably makes it feel somewhat secondhand. Just another mediocre fantasy flick, but if you enjoyed the books, I'm sure you'll enjoy the film. Chris Columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless, episodic fantasy saga based on the young-reader book series by Rick Riordan.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 5.8,\n        \"max\": 5.8,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5.8\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"critics_consensus\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Though it may seem like just another Harry Potter knockoff, Percy Jackson benefits from a strong supporting cast, a speedy plot, and plenty of fun with Greek mythology.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

By the time A Christmas Carol finishes piling its many shiny presents with their many bells and whistles under the tree, there's no room left for tears for Tiny Tim. Bah humbug indeed. It's nice of Hollywood to go to all the trouble but, honestly, Dickens doesn't need the help. The motion capture animation is top-notch and it's hard not to be impressed with what Robert Zemeckis has wrought, even if there's the occasional sense he's pandering to an audience that can't get through a 90 minute story without a few yuks and a chase. The director has brought this Charles Dickens classic to such vivid life that in some ways you feel like you are experiencing it for the first time A re-telling should either present a resonant or fresh thematic take. This Christmas Carol seems like a pale ghost of Dickens' magical Christmas classic. As a movie to get you in the Christmas spirit, A Christmas Carol does its job nicely. If you want realism, use actors. If you want animation, use your imagination. Sadly, imagination is missing from this technically impressive but emotionally inert film. There is an almost constant deadness to the eyes that is deeply distracting, while each person's movements are so ungainly and wild even Gumby would look at them all wandering around and wonder why they look so uncomfortably odd. Mr. Zemeckis has always been a talented, if less than subtle, director. And his \\\"Carol\\\" is never dull. But it also never justifies its own existence. A clear step in the right direction for Zemeckis and his pet techno-project, the film nonetheless ultimately sabotages itself by prizing the hectic over the heartfelt. One cannot help but feel the same effect could have been accomplished by simply making a live action film with state-of-the-art visual effects. What's curious about the movie is that you can tart it up all you want, but Dickens' words still resonate, his characters still infuriate, frighten and touch, and there's still satisfaction to be had in his tale. Most of us know the beginning, middle, and uplifting end. However, the hook this time is a trifecta: 3-D, digital imagery, and Jim Carrey. That hook makes this 'Christmas Carol' worth seeing. You don't need glasses -- 3-D or otherwise -- to see that this holiday release is too diluted for adults, too frightening for children, and too tiresome for just about everybody. The elegant simplicity of Dickens' novel is lost somewhere underneath the eye-popping visuals, whittled down to nothing more than a series of pixels and binary code. A chilly, cold-to-the-touch interpretation. This motion-capture animated adaptation is a real Christmas cracker. Clear evidence of the limitations of the performance-capture method of animation and of the excesses it invites...there's more of artifice than art in it. Zemeckis' motion-capture animated features continue to be odd presents, offering undeniable technical skill with a host of other obstacles hindering total enjoyment. Jamais deixa de impressionar. Too bad though, that for all the eye-popping spirits on screen, it lacks a soul. Hold onto your mug of warm apple cider. This newest, action-packed version of A Christmas Carol could get a little bumpy. Its' lavish details bridge the gap between the real and the imagined in a way heretofore impossible.. the filmmakers have put most of their magic in the media and not the message. In the end you don't have to analyze it... that tear in your eye tells you it's working. Really, who cares? The essence of the story has been lost in the process. Give me The Muppet Christmas Carol any day. This is a faithful retelling of the story, proving that strong tales such as these are better off without embellishment. The enhancements here come, not to the source material but to the look of the film, which is beautifully rendered in immersive 3D. The holiday spirit feels real, but the film does not. Are the less than perfectly executed bits supposed to set off the truly terrific ones, or are the truly terrific ones supposed to distract the viewing audience from the bits that go clunk in the night? By the time it's over, you'll have to be a real Scrooge yourself to not have at least a little bit of the Christmas spirit instilled into you.\",\n          \"It's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull, nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish. Feels aimless for much of its running time, until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives, leaving questions in its wake. Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes. One of those American independent comedies that suffers from a serious case of the lonely-girl cutes. A witty little thriller emerges as Zoe, under house arrest, resourcefully stretches her electronic anklet's restrictions. A movie about mistrust of the system, personal inertia, and the melancholy stasis of everyday life. A mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make 'Cherish' a very good (but not great) movie. Turns into the most routine of stories, its originality discarded in favor of a template for a story we've seen dozens of times before. The idea is more interesting than the screenplay, which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy, unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run. An uneven mix of genres that, even when it misses the mark, gets points for originality and a good beat. While Cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller, it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem. Sometimes a good idea, a lot of enthusiasm and a shoestring budget just aren't enough. Robin Tunney turns Zoe's socialization and investigation into little revelations - sculpting her magnetic, melancholy presence as perfectly as her buff body in third-act action where she sheds, and draws, blood for a climax driven by robust reclamations. The soundtrack is a boisterous blast from the past, and there's a quiet pleasure to watching Zoe and Daly let their composure loose like scrambled eggs, but there's little else to hold dear here. An imaginative comedy/thriller. A quirky stalker film that starts out with a few surprising turns and then keeps on giving them. The thriller side of this movie is falling flat, as the stalker doesn't do much stalking, and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case. Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness. In the end, it's a movie with multiple-personality disorder, but most of its personalities are fun to hang with. Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional. An endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick. It's a strained romantic comedy that starts promisingly, takes a hard left turn and slowly falls apart. Both improbable and absorbing. \\\"Cherish\\\" is on the cusp of being too weird to work. ...Tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character, an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope. The directing and story are disjointed, flaws that have to be laid squarely on Taylor's doorstep. But the actors make this worth a peek. Cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film. Not always too whimsical for its own good (but enough to do harm), this strange hybrid of crime thriller, quirky character study, third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs. Cherish is a million genres and ideas all at once. As off-putting and mysteriously endearing as its heroine.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"top_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"critics_consensus\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Vintage MGM musical stuff, characterized by Stanley Donen's fleet direction and some amazing dance performances from star Fred Astaire.\",\n          \"Robert Zemeckis' 3-D animated take on the Dickens classic tries hard, but its dazzling special effects distract from an array of fine performances from Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman.\",\n          \"The different genres in Cherish don't mesh well, and the quirkiness sometimes feels too forced.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"royal wedding is a mildly entertaining film , but it suffers from some slight flaws .\",\n          \"uplifting and heartfelt , disney 's a christmas carol captures the spirit and beauty of the holiday season .\",\n          \"a cutesy romantic comedy that keeps you guessing until the very end\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.27135372161865234,\n          0.28938809037208557,\n          0.28876346349716187\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
